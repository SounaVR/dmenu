# Souna's Arch Tools 🐧🛠️
Welcome ! Here's one of the tools I use on my Arch installation, and it's obviously subject to evolution and improvement.

The main goal of this kind of repo is to keep "backups" in case I break anything.

Also it'll be very useful for my **future custom arch install interactive script** 🔥.

### Oh ? Interested by using it ? Nothing special but.. Why not.

Install `libxft-bgra` with your package manager.

Clone the repo by typing the following lines in a terminal

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SounaVR/dmenu.git
cd dmenu
sudo make install
```

If you don't have [dwm](https://github.com/SounaVR/dwm) already, you can't invoke the dmenu.

Otherwise, you can hit (<kbd>super+space</kbd>) to use it. 

### Editing the appearance 🎨

Edit the `config.h` to suit your needs, then do

```bash
make
```
